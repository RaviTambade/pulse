Certainly! Below is an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for the tables used in the **PlusCare Application** based on the provided MySQL schema. The ERD represents the relationships between the key entities: **users**, **appointments**, **prescriptions**, **feedback**, and other related tables.

---

### **Entities and Relationships:**

1. **Users Table**: Stores information about users (patients, doctors, etc.)
2. **Appointments Table**: Stores details about appointments booked by users with doctors.
3. **Prescriptions Table**: Stores prescriptions provided by doctors to users.
4. **Feedback Table**: Stores feedback given by users for doctors.

### **ERD Explanation:**

1. **Users** (one-to-many) **Appointments**:
   - A user (patient) can have multiple appointments, but each appointment is linked to one user.

2. **Users** (one-to-many) **Prescriptions**:
   - A user can have multiple prescriptions, but each prescription is linked to one user.

3. **Doctors** (one-to-many) **Appointments**:
   - A doctor can have multiple appointments, but each appointment is linked to one doctor.

4. **Doctors** (one-to-many) **Prescriptions**:
   - A doctor can prescribe multiple prescriptions, but each prescription is linked to one doctor.

5. **Users** (one-to-many) **Feedback**:
   - A user can provide feedback for different doctors, but feedback is related to a specific user and doctor.

### **Steps to Create the ER Diagram Visually:**

To create a proper visual ER diagram, follow these steps:

1. **Use ERD Tools**: Use any ERD tool like:
   - [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/)
   - [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
   - [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
   - [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

2. **Add Entities**: For each table (like Users, Appointments, Feedback), create an entity with attributes listed in the previous section.

3. **Define Relationships**:
   - Draw a **one-to-many** relationship between:
     - Users and Appointments
     - Users and Prescriptions
     - Doctors and Appointments
     - Doctors and Prescriptions
     - Users and Feedback
   - For each relationship, use lines to connect entities, and label them with cardinality (one-to-many, many-to-many).

4. **Optional Tables**: You can add additional tables for location-based services, if needed (e.g., `Locations` for healthcare facilities).
