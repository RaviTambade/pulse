### **3. Key Considerations for the Gantt Chart:**

- **Dependencies**: Tasks like **Frontend Development** depend on the completion of **Wireframing & Prototyping**, and **Backend Development** depends on the **Database Schema Design**.
- **Overlapping Phases**: Development and design tasks can overlap, and some testing tasks (like unit testing) can begin as soon as development milestones are completed.
- **Buffer Time**: Allow for additional buffer time between tasks to accommodate unforeseen challenges, especially during development and testing.

---

### **4. Tools for Creating Gantt Chart:**

- **Trello** or **Jira**: Use these project management tools to track tasks and progress, as they also allow for simple Gantt chart integrations.
- **Microsoft Project** or **Smartsheet**: Ideal for more comprehensive Gantt chart creation and project tracking.
- **Google Sheets** or **Excel**: For a simpler approach, you can manually create a Gantt chart using tables or Gantt chart templates available online.

By following this **planning and scheduling**, you will ensure the **PlusCare Application** is delivered on time, within scope, and meets the functional requirements set at the beginning of the project.
